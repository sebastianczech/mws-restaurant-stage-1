## Before starting reviews

In files ``index.html`` and ``restaurant.html`` I have't left my Google API keys, so you have to [generate yours using e.g. these instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and put it in both files, where there is ``YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY``.

## Starting application locally

After cloning repository from GitHub, you can start the application using e.g. command started from directory, which contains sources: ``python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``.
